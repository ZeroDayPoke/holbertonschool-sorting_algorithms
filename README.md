## Synopsis

This project is a collection of various sorting algorithms and their implementation in C programming language. The goal of this project is to understand how these algorithms work and their time complexity.

## File Descriptions

- `0-bubble_sort.c`: This file contains the implementation of the Bubble sort algorithm. It sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm.

- `1-insertion_sort_list.c`: This file contains the implementation of the Insertion sort algorithm. It sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Insertion sort algorithm.

- `2-selection_sort.c`: This file contains the implementation of the Selection sort algorithm. It sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Selection sort algorithm.

- `3-quick_sort.c`: This file contains the implementation of the Quick sort algorithm. It sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Quick sort algorithm.
